This is a wifi scanner project build for scanning your surrounding wifi and it's strength in dbms.
==================================================================================================
compo used:
1. ESP 32 WROOM
2. OLED DISPLAY (SPI BASED)
3. JUMPER WIRES
4. BREADBOARD
==================================================================================================
In case the oled doesn't light up then it may be the problem of your oled library in my case my oled
 is based on U8g2lib and it worked when i installed the required libraries from the arduino ide application.
==================================================================================================
THINGS TO KEEP IN YOUR MIND WHILE BUILDING:
#Also check the wiring and connect the display to your 3.3 V PORT ONLY otherwise the oled can get burned up
